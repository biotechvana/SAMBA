The empirical testing set was built using the data of three previously published experiences concerning different amplicon-based sequencing approaches to analyze the autochthonous microbiota population of anterior and posterior regions of the intestinal mucus of 72 fish. Briefly, the experiments disclosed how this gut microbiota varied, after three different feeding trials, in response to novel diets formulated with diverse ingredients, such as single-cell bacterial proteins and processed animal proteins (LSAQUA; PRJNA713764; Solé-Jiménez et al., 2021), and bioactive compounds like egg hydrolysates (EGGHYDRO; PRJNA705868; Naya-Català et al., 2021) and functional additives (GAIN_PRE; PRJNA750446; Piazzon et al., 2022).
